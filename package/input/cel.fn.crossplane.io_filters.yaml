              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
              may reject unrecognized values.

          filters:
            description: |-
              Filters to apply to the desired composed resources produced by previous
              functions in the pipeline. Each filter matches a desired composed
              resource by name. If the expression evaluates to true, the composed
              resource will be included. Desired composed resources that don't match
              any filter are always included.

                A Filter can be used to filter a desired composed resource produced by a

                expression:

                    Expression is a CEL expression. See https://github.com/google/cel-spec.
                    The following top-level variables are available to the expression:

                    * observed
                    * desired
                    * context

                    Example expressions:

                    * observed.composite.resource.spec.widgets == 42
                    * observed.resources['composed'].connection_details['user'] == b'admin'
                    * desired.resources['composed'].resource.spec.widgets == 42

                    See the RunFunctionRequest protobuf message for schema details.

                    Name of the desired composed resource(s) this filter should match.

                    Use regular expressions to match multiple resources. Expressions are
                    automatically prefixed with ^ and suffixed with $. For example 'buck.*'
                    becomes '^buck.*$'. See https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax.
